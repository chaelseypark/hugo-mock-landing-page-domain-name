# hugo-mock-landing-page

This repository contains an automatically deployed Hugo-based static website using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. The workflow ensures that any changes pushed to the main branch trigger a build and deployment process. The deployment process is fully automated and utilizes continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) principles to update the website whenever new changes are pushed to the main branch.
